My last update to you recorded the arrival of a stranger new to town, who moved into the abandoned villa past the al-Luq residence. I have just learned that he recently  encouraged the bearer of this message to visit a \"friend\" of his in the Darkened Halls to the north of here. Once there, the adventurer who stands before you was attacked on all sides by a party of Hollow Minions, who were obviously lying in ambush for unwary explorers. There was a terrible device in the depths of the Halls, \n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Dame Tsaya","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"ostensibly created to extract  a living being's vitals from his own skin, leaving only a perfect human epidermis.

I have had reports that a farmer living on the outskirts of town had recently been acting extremely strangely--acting genially towards his customers one minute, then shouting and berating them in the next. What's more, he claimed to have come into a large inheritance-which is odd, because everyone in town  knows his parents remained in Ispar.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Dame Tsaya","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"After interviewing the farmer, the bearer of this message found a trap door towards the rear of his house, leading down to a seeminly innocuous cellar.

There must be breach in our security-the Queen must be notified at once.\n\n--Tenshin\n"}]}}
