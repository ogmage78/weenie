Near the city, she found a Temple of the Dragon of Power beside the road.  At the time, Koji mistrusted the Dragon of Power, for everyone taught how fickle the Dragon was, but she stopped at the Temple to rest for the night anyway.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Koji and the Dragon","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"Toward midnight, the sky suddenly flashed with light, and rain began to fall.  Koji peered outside the temple and watched as a great white serpent descended to the ground.\n\n\"I am Bairyuu, servant to the Dragon,\" said the white serpent.  \"The Dragon has heard that you are a wise young woman of exceptional skill.  The Dragon now gives you a portion of the Dragon's own Power, as a test of your Discipline.\"\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Koji and the Dragon","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"But Koji remembered the Dragon's fickleness.  \"But, oh Bairyuu,\" she said, \"I do not seek power.  I do not want it.\"\n\nBairyuu laughed.  \"You have been given Power to call whenever you will, and you shall keep this Power for five years.  At the end, the Dragon will speak with you to see which of you has won - you or Power, Temptation or Discipline.

At the end of five years, Koji was traveling back to the Dragon Temple near the capital.  Along the way, she came to a mountain.  She could not go around, for to either side were rivers, and so she had to climb.  As the noonday sun beat down upon her, the voice of the Bairyuu said, \"Call now for your Power, little Koji.  With Power, you could soon leap over this small hill and be on your way.\"\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Koji and the Dragon","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\"No,\" said Koji, \"for effort and toil is the way of Man, and I have no right to avoid it.\"  And she went on her way, and climbed over the mountain.  Thus Koji showed her own Humility.\n\nThen Koji was walking along the river.  Along the way, she saw a tree ripe with delicious-looking apples across the water.  But the water was too swift for fording.  Then the voice of Bairyuu said, \"Call now for your Power, little Koji.  With Power, you could soon leap over the water and take those apples.\"\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Koji and the Dragon","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\"No,\" said Koji.  \"I have enough provisions for my journey; I do not need apples to make it, as delicious as they look.\"  And she went on her way, eating her own supplies, and leaving the apples behind.

She tried carrying him, but soon she tired.  She knew, though, that unless she took the man to the city, he might die.  Then the voice of Bairyuu said, \"Call now for your Power, little Koji.  With Power, you could pick up the man and carry him easily to the capital.\"\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Koji and the Dragon","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\"Yet, this would mean that I have lost to Power, by using it,\" thought Koji.  \"But no, that is not as important as this person's life. I must use what I can to save him.  I call upon Power and I shall face the Dragon's maw myself.\"\n\nSuddenly her limbs were given great strength, and she easily picked up the man and carried him to the capital, where his wounds were bound and his life was saved.  Thus, she chose Compassion.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Koji and the Dragon","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"Koji now went bravely to the Temple of the Dragon of Power.  There, the Bairyuu appeared before her again, and said in triumph, \"You have used the Power of the Dragon at last.
