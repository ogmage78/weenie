This portal won't take you to a safe town or anything. No, this one will take you to a nasty underground crypt full of monsters. Outsiders call it \"Rithwic Crypt\", but we just call it unpleasant. I've heard that deep inside that crypt you might find a mysterious key. There's outlandish rumors about that key and just what it might be good for, but I can't tell you anything more about it. No one who lives around here really knows what it's for, but I've heard that Iquba, the barkeep in Qalaba'r, might know more.\n"}]}}
