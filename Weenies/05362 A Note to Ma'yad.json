This assignment I took from old Akyafi the Translator is boring, but in truth I welcome the task for it has given me time to think.\n\nI realize now that I was wrong; this life that I have chosen may give the appearance of freedom, but it is a freedom born of exile and loneliness. I miss you, and more, I miss the times we spent together, you and I, with our father. \n\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Abmim ibn Ibsar","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\nDo you think that if I renounce my old life he will welcome me back?

I would speak with him again, and not in anger this time, but in love, and I would respect his advice and the wisdom of his years. \n\nI am going to investigate the Pillars of the Inner Sea now. When I am done with this task, I will come to your tent and we will talk. \n\nYours in family,\nAbmim\n"}]}}
