I've heard a long-dead evil lich holds it somewhere in what's called The Halls of Helm.  You'd better be well-prepared for this one!  To get there, follow the road out of Zaikhal but take the left fork, and look in the area to the north of the road, in the hills.  Watch out for monsters along the way.  Oh, and I heard an overly curious food merchant lost all his goods down in that dungeon.\n\n"}]}}
