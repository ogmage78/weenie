While excavating the lower levels our engineers broke into a system of olthoi tunnels. The olthoi attacked. We were unprepared and they killed most of our warriors, including Commander Lokoth. Our remaining troops hold the top level. I request immediate reinforcements.\n\nVery Respectfully,\nNoptok, Srgt.\nNorthern Garrison\n"}]}}
