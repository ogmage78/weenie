She had been a girlhood friend of Elysa Starthelar and corresponded with her quite often. I believe the letters Elysa wrote to her are a clue to her whereabouts. I would reward you if you could aid me in this matter. You may find me in the town of Cragstone and I will provide you with the details.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGlysander Cartoth\n\n"}]}}
