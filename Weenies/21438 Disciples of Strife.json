They spent their time within the very fire of volcanoes and studied the effect of the Blood of the World on their magical arts. Their fractious nature left very little room for deep study, or so it appears. The only remnant that I was able to collect from their halls in regards to their involvement with the calling of this being from the depths of the world was the canon that they followed.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Unknown","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"Oddly, this Canon was well composed and much more rigid than those of their brethren. \n\nWhen I unleashed my wrath upon these foes, I was unable to torture the truth from any of them. They were too used to the flames to be affected by the methods of persuasion at my command. Likewise it appears that any of my spies that attempted to infiltrate their ranks were either dismissed or simply could not survive within the order. \n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Unknown","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"My generals were candid with me in explaining that some of these Disciples escaped their grasp. Worse they were able to abscond with a most important relic. The purpose of the relic was two fold. One, it was a navigational beacon that could be affixed to my citadel. Two, it was a device that could create an impenetrable field around the citadel proper. While within the bounds of this device the citadel would become impassible to any being with Yalain blood. Misfortunes do happen.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Unknown","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"Misfortunes, odd how they compound. One moment you are within striking distance of you foe, the next at his mercy. It is true in this instance. We were close, so very close to regaining the seat of this world. If the Disciples of Strife had been less formidable we would have claimed the relic and learned more of what they intended. But they were prepared, waiting, and they had found a way to escape and to shield themselves from discovery.\n\nWe were lax.
