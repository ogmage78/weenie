You will come to a great range of hills -- I can scarce call it mountains, though some flatlanders might. Here, in a low-roofed crevice, you will find the entrance to the Cave. Remember that you must have the other six keys before you venture through!\n\nIf you need more explicit directions, send a message to me and I will try to be more clear.\n"}]}}
