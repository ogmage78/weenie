I suspect the Virindi may have something to do with its present condition; however, I doubt they were the originators of the trouble.  One can see the later Empyrean who lived here - or sought to live here - struggled and ultimately failed to tame the portal magic of this city.

I spoke briefly with Elysa Strathelar yesterday, and the dear lady worried that I might become trapped in this city if I did not leave soon.  I seriously doubt such an accident might befall someone like myself, especially as there seem to be no shortage of portals leading out.  Still, it is clear that I should write these notes today, without delay, lest I not have the opportunity to return and leave my musings for a far distant posterity.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"After all, perhaps some invisible wave or current in portal space might bring these portals back to Dereth.
