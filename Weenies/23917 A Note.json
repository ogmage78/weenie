We have been given a chance at freedom, a chance to build a new homeland free from our old masters and the outdated traditions of our old world. \n\nRally your commanders and your warriors, gather them beneath your banner, and convene with us in the brushlands near besieged Dryreach. There we shall unite our people, and train a vast horde to carve out our freedom.\n"}]}}
