I write to update you on the latest developments here in Shoushi as well as Holtburg.  I have had reports that a farmer living on the outskirts of town had recently been acting extremely strangely-acting genially towards his customers one minute, then shouting and berating them in the next. What's more, he claimed to have come into a large inheritance-which is odd, because everyone in town  knows his parents remained in Ispar.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Sir Tenshin","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"After interviewing the farmer, the bearer of this message found a trap door towards the rear of his house, leading down to a seeminly innocuous cellar.

I have recently been keeping surveillance on one of the newer citizens of this town-a \"reformed\" bandit from Marae Lassel claiming to have turned over a new leaf. It appears that this stranger is not as he claimed. A note found in his possession implies that he was employed to transport a cargo of some sort of substance being collected in the depths of Asuger Temple.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Sir Tenshin","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"The adventurer you see before you penetrated the depths of the temple and found a band of Hollow Minions laboring over a strange device, collecting  what looks to be concentrated portal space energy inside emulsified spherules of glass.
