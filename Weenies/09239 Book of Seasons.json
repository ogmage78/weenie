However, it seems that while the seasons change, the fauna does not.  At least not until now.\n\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Gillian the Hunter","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\nRecently, during my scouting of Dereth, I noticed some of the newly arrived fauna finally adapting to the Derethian seasons.

Recently, their hides have begun to thicken, resulting in the occasional shreth hide, which is useful in making armor for your hands and feet.  If a large enough hide could be found, it is possible you could even make pants out of it.  Bring whatever you find to your local leather crafter.  I'm certain he can do something with it.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Gillian the Hunter","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\nSclavus:  These upright canvas bags are great sources of new shoes, coats, and the occasional head gear, if you're into that.  I guess that it's molting season for these nasty creatures, and they are more ornery than normal, so be careful if you see one.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Gillian the Hunter","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\nUrsuins:  At the beginning of the winter I released a book about how fast the Ursuin adapted to the environment.  Well, the fact is, that was an understatement.  Now they've gone and adapted to the summer too!  Their coats are all soft and wonderful now, and even better for skinning, if not as padded as the winter ones were.  Hope they don't keep going at this rate.  Soon they'll stand on their back legs and start asking for a Portal to Teth with the rest of us!\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Gillian the Hunter","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\nWell, that's all for now.
