This door, for example, can be unlocked with a key sold by the shopkeeper.  If you haven't bought the key, go ahead and buy it.  Now, to unlock the door, double-click the key in your Inventory, and then click on the door.  Locked doors are only locked in one direction, so that you won't be locked into a room.  But be warned: keys usually have a limited number of uses!\n"}]}}
