Acolyte Frisirth has been of great aid, using his powers to shape the tunnels without need of spade or shovel. This magic was unknown to us, but it seems Frisirth's family had preserved some of the most eldritch of the Falatacot magics. He himself believes that it is one of the spells used by the gods the witches worshipped in the swamps, from the time before men crawled across the land. I do not know what use these land-shaping spells may have been to them, but...\n\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Ferundi","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\n...amazing discovery! Frisirth had gone on of his own accord, casting tunnels above the main level of Frore. He claims he felt called onwards.\n\nThe crystal is enormous, a pale sliver spinning slowly in place. It emits a light which seems most peculiar to my eye; as if every object within its radiance cast a second shadow, violet and flickering in and out of vision. But my eyes are not quite what they were, after all; I could be mistaken.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Ferundi","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\nOr perhaps this is merely an expected effect, due to the power contained within it.

We cannot discern what it may be, but Frisirth assures us that it is harmless. I am concerned about the lad - he has spent more and more of his time poring over the more obscure of the surviving Falatacot texts - the Uotecatl Ceqt of Nahouhnztl, and the fragments of the Book of Eibhil. In the past year, the Council has barely seen him, as he continues his experiments on the crystal. When last we spoke he was agitated and distracted, but assured us that he was drawing close to finding a use for the crystal which would answer the prophesy of the Fourth Sending.\n\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Ferundi","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\n...crystal's magical bond to the depths of the world will allow us to draw the heat out of it, as volcanoes do. By this drawing and containing of the heat-energy within the earth, we will bring about the Great Frost we have sought for so long. Fennagar expressed the opinion that drawing such heat into our city of ice might be fatal, but Frisirth seemed quite convinced that the crystal can contain it safely. It is hard to check the lad - he seems overjoyed that his work might be used to bring the prophesy to fruition, and allow us to return home.\n\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Ferundi","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\nHome!

He said that Frisirth has had an unhealthy glow in his eyes of late. I laughed at the choice of words, and he amended to an unwholesome glow.

The Council and the Lords had ringed the crystal, and had begun to weave together the strands that would allow us to collectively bend the force within it to our needs.
