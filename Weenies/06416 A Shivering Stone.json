They were returning from the assaults on Frore, and became lost in a late blizzard. They took shelter in a small ice hut right on the edge of the Lost Wish Mountains, directly east of Holtburg and north of Cragstone. Inside they discovered a strange blue stone and a book. These seem to be artifacts of some lost form of Empyrean technology. Maybe you should investigate.\n"}]}}
