The evening clouds over the darker limb of the land muttered and answered each other in blue and white flashes.  Ma'yani floated along the courses of the river, the sky filling with jewels beyond the ken of any Malik.  The greenery dropped away, and the face of the brown water was sprinkled with fine dust, and Ma'yani knew then that this was the edge of the great Naqut, which divides the land of Milantos from the decaying Roulean Empire.  Here it was that the people known as Gharu'ndim lived and live.\n\n(more)\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"On the edge of the bank there appeared a village, beaten to a pale brown by the sun.
