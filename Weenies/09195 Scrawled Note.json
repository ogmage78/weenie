Walker magic is quite unlike ours. I am not sure it may even be called magic.

However, I observed them manifest tools of such cunning subtlety that Dericost at its height could not equal them. One called forth a small, curved blade that effortlessly peeled the epidermis from one scavenger, leaving the tissue beneath entirely undisturbed. With this, I was shown details of the creature's subcutaneous circulatory system.

Their attempts to explain were unfortunately fruitless. \"The space around you is not an abeyance, but a vapor-sea. We take the insubstantials and alter arrangements so they assume solidity.\" The Director added that, \"In this, your location is convenient to us.\" Not sure what this implies, may be important.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"I also witnessed a Walker focusing electrical blasts to such a fine point that they could be used to slice and cauterize flesh.\nI should note here that the scavengers are held in some strange form of stasis during the conversion process. They are kept alive and awake throughout the conversion, but prevented from taking any action whatsoever. Whereas we would provoke unconsciousness or use physical bindings, the Walkers claim to have a process that, in their words, \"Disjoints will from the flesh paths.\"\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"The most remarkable portion of the conversion involved neither mechanical tools nor direction of the subtle energy. In truth, I can offer no suggestion as to what I witnessed. While the scavengers were paralyzed as detailed above, a small amount of surgery was performed on them - mostly related to the insertion of two additional organs in the torso and skull. The Walkers indicated these allowed the creatures to manipulate mana.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"This is, naturally, sacrilege, as we all know the ability to wield the subtle energy is a gift from the gods. It is long proven that no particular organ in the Empyrean species circumscribes the ability. (See: vivisections described in volume XVII of Lady Hiria's \"Maps of the Physical Man.\" Does Lord R. have copy?) The Walkers are most assuredly not gods.\nAt any rate, the bulk of the visible changes appeared to be accomplished via a simple pin.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"A scavenger was placed on a pedestal, and was surrounded by an odd blue glow. \"Barrier,\" they called it, and I could gain no more information. One of the attending Walkers manifested a pin of about forearm's length from its \"arm.\" This was stuck through the barrier and into the arm of the scavenger. I was naturally curious and attempted to move closer, only to find a diamond scythe manifested under my chin. \"Distance,\" one of the Conversion Masters commanded. \"Only alter active flesh. You are inactive, yet flesh. Perhaps they get confused. Prudence: avoid contamination of spaces beyond barrier.\"\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"The effect of this pin on the creature was instant and remarkable. Its flesh turned grey at the point of contact, and this spread out from that center along the paths of the circulatory system they had just shown me. Eventually, the entire form was grey. At a slightly slower pace, its limbs could be seen to swell with additional musculature. In light of this unique effect, I have begun to refer to this Walker art as \"crawling magic.\"\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"When the epidermal change reached the eyes, they bled briefly, then changed color to red. \"Better in this place's common-light,\" the Conversion Master said. \"Pale somatics optimized for nocturnal activity.

The scavenger stood up and blinked its now strangely crystalline eyes. It stumbled and fell, blinking rapidly and shrieking. It cringed and held its crude hands up as if to ward away things I could not see. \"Unused to multi-vibration sense. Things beyond accustomed frequencies disturb. Will harden.\" Turning to a Puppet, the Conversion Master said, \"Store. Next.\" The Puppet manifested a pair of tongs, clamped them around the scavenger's neck, and dragged it away towards the waiting cells.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"It clawed at its own eyes, but the Watchers seemed unconcerned.

Many of the lower castes - and I think it safe to refer to them as castes, since they have assigned functions - use inclusive pronouns when referring to themselves. Puppets, of course, rarely speak. I questioned a Master about them once, and was told, \"As in flesh species, some are inferior. Inferior are emptied to serve as extra appendages for others. I have three. Useful.\"\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"With a Servant, it is always \"we\" or \"us.\" This becomes less common with members of the more sophisticated castes. Masters mix their \"we's\" and \"I's,\" their \"my's\" and \"our's.\" Directors almost always use singular pronouns. An important exception is when speaking to the nearly mute Observers. At these times, they use the inclusive. If they were mortal, I expect the Directors would sweat when under the attentions of an Observer.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"I have little more to offer, then, than what we already knew. The Walkers arrived in the period between the flight of the Yalain and the arrival of the large grey outlanders. Their reason for coming remains inscrutable. They appear to be a conjoined mind, but have begun to exhibit en masse what the Observers refer to as \"aberrance.\" That is, individuality. I must say that this new trait has done little to ameliorate their ascetic, almost solipsistic view of the world.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"For the Walkers seem entirely uninterested in either our ancient and glorious culture, or in us. I am treated politely and decently, but ultimately with no more consideration than they would give to a research subject. When I ask a question, they answer. When I request an item, they provide it. No questions are put to me, and they ask nothing of me. I am free to wander as I please among their various facilities, but since that first tour, I have been provided with no guide. None of them speak to me save when I speak first.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":" I have stood in one corridor for hours on end, unmoving, and the endless train of indistinguishable cloaked figures merely flowed around me, never remarking on my obstruction or unusual behavior.\nI believe that these entities simply do not care that we exist.

Most often, they refer to me as \"Dericost Scribe,\" my people and function. They may recognize our most luminous nobles, the Steward and Lady Aerfalle, for example, as the equal of a Director or Observer.
