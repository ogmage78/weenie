It still may be too late.  What they have planned...what they are still planning...the loss of blood makes it hard for me to concentrate.  \n\nWho knew that there would be things to fear in a world where death takes no one?\n\nI would find the naivete of the innocent amusing, were I still innocent.

Where did I come from?  They cannot take away my very identity, can they?  I am still...I have always been...\n\nMy name is Sir Candeth Martine.  I think.  Most of the time.\n\nA few weeks I ago I had resolved to talk about my past on Ispar, to inscribe my story in a text more permanent than the apparently flimsy human mind.  But I soon forgot to write it down.  And now I can no more recall my Isparian past than I could recall what life was like in my mother's womb.  It is gone.  \n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"What about my life in Dereth?

So I will write quickly.  I have kept the above in this letter, to let the reader know what I am facing.

I have been an outcast from my homeworld for some time now.  I used to know how long.  Through some uncommon good fortune, I was able to discover a Society that had sprouted up on this alien world.  My fellow members of the Society and myself resolved to explore and discover this new world, to learn the secrets of its flora and fauna, and be able to share this knowledge with ourselves and our fellow lost Isparians.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"It was through a mission given to me by the Society that I came upon a large group of Mosswarts.

This may be a title instead of a name.  It is ironic to me that I have been given an opportunity to spend more time with the Mosswarts than I ever thought possible, and yet their language remains opaque to me.  And considering what they gave me when I asked for food, the reverse seems true as well.  But I digress.  I am sometimes prone to digression) along with a cadre of his largest warriors absconded with me and their apparently sacred Mosswart shroud.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"We made our way through the endless sands in darkness.  I was cold, hungry and exhausted.  I had not been able to enjoy any taste of freedom for many days.  I could not recall a time since I had arrived in Dereth where I had been so close to the point of complete physical and mental collapse.  \n\nI was foolish not to be able to enjoy paradise when I saw it.

I have heard from many of my friends and colleagues about the mass Tusker slaughters that go on throughout the land.  Hours are spent reveling in the blood and guts of these huge beasts.  How can humans stand it?  After spending some time with Tuskers who managed to keep their blood and guts on the inside for the duration of the visit, I cannot comprehend how much worse their stench can get.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"It is easier for me if I focus on the Tuskers.  The other minions are...too much like their masters.  \n\nWhy were the Mosswarts meeting with the...the...those things?  If only I could decipher what was said.  The portal was opened, Arg Marg stepped through along with his bodyguards and the shroud.  They were obviously very happy when the portal was created.  Even happier to step through.  I had thought they might at least try and say goodbye.  At the time I wondered what the Mosswarts had to exchange in return for such obvious favors.
