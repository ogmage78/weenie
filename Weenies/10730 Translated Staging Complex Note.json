They were easily acquired in Adirred's raid on the human desert town.  We managed to capture most of the humans, but their leader and a craftsman of their pitiable \"bow\" devices escaped.  En route to your facility, we discarded three humans who did not exhibit sufficient signs of individuality.  Additionally, a human sage who seemed to be resistant to most of our pacification techniques and Adirred's conditioning has escaped, and we were unable to locate the troublesome meat puppet.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Unknown","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"Still, I express hope that the eight specimens we delivered to you prove to be useful.

Experiencing anticipation, I await word on your progress with the great experiment.\n"}]}}
