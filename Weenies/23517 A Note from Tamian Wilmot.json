This mighty tower, calling from the earth to the heavens. Calling for the love Saolor Lentain could never have! No matter the powerful Empyrean builder or the meek human- all fall to the intrigues of the heart.\n\nAstara, I will extend, nay, continue my journey to seek the building craft of the Empyrean.  I will go off to the wilds. I am stronger now. Someday I will be back. I will come for you, my love.\n\nTamian\n"}]}}
