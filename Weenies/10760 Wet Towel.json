If you've found this towel then rough circumstances have caused me to part ways with my indispensable traveling aid. Most likely I dropped this charging to the rescue of my disaster-prone fellow traveler, A.D. My friend, you see, has a pronounced predilection to get himself in all sorts of trouble. The other day, for instance, we were taking a pleasant walk down the beach when he angered a mud puddle, which rose up and attacked him viciously. In my attempt to come to his defense, I was assaulted and engulfed by what looked like an angry, two-legged wave. That experience was most unpleasantly like being drunk.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"F.P.","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"I may have to reconsider my assessment of this strange little island when I've compiled my travel guide.
