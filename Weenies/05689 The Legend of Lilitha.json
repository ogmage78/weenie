In the early days of Elysa Strathelar's reign, Lilitha refused to be bound by duty or conscience, and plunged without care into the dark woods of Tiofor.  Leaving behind all else, she traveled with bow and arrow into the wilds, slaying all manner of beasts and creatures - and even the people who sought to oppose her, it is said.  So she earned the name Hunter.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Legend of Lilitha","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"Monsters' teeth and horns she collected, and wore them upon herself.  Gromnie teeth she turned into arrow heads; auroch horn she turned into spears.  She is even said to have worn a helm crafted from a slain Olthoi, and of this she was most proud.

Where is she now?  No one knows.  Perhaps she has traveled on, with her arrows and her wild love of the hunt, into the next life.\n"}]}}
