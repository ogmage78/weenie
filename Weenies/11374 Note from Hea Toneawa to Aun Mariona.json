I fear the Hea have become aware of our affections. The emnity between our xutas is too bitter. I know our love will be despised, and I fear for your safety. Lovely Mariona, steal away from Timaru, run away with me to the mainland. We could make a fresh start there, far from the baleful glances of our kindred. I will try my best to meet you on the morrow. Know that the trusted bearer of this missive also carries all my love to you.\n\nYour Toneawa\n\n"}]}}
