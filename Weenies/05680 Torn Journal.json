Asjan and I were discussing worker productivity when there was a soft knock at the door.  Upon opening it, a violet-cloaked figure wearing a mask floated - floated! - in the air before us.  Asjan gasped and froze.  I asked this creature if I could help it, reasoning that since it knocked politely, in our fashion, it must have Intellect.  The Thing introduced itself as \"Lord Sarvaen,\" a noble of Arwic, and offered me a business proposition.  I asked what it had in mind.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Cambarth","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\"Sarvaen\" floated in the room, the ragged trailings of its cloak fluttering, and explained that it had need for the unique crystals I had discovered in the mountain.  Its voice was... Ah, but I lack the words.  Deep it was, and oddly cadenced.  It was beyond question not a man's voice, and sounded as if it came through a tunnel, or from the grave.  Straight-faced, I asked what it offered in turn.  At this, one violet-draped \"arm\" rose and placed a gem upon the table.  I did not see its hand for the folds of the cloak.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Cambarth","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"It was a ruby; large, flawless, and more finely cut than any stone I have ever seen.  I have not the words to do justice to this amazing artifact.\n\nExchanging raw crystal of undetermined worth for such incredible craftsmanship seemed like a sound decision, so I offered to draw up a contract.  \"Sarvaen's\" cloak rippled, as if a swarm of insects were beating against the interior, and it said that true men preferred to do business without records.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Cambarth","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"At this, Asjan's nerve snapped, and he ran from the room shrieking hysterically.  The Thing turned to mark his passage, and I believe I saw a flash of violet-blue light from behind the corner of its bizarre mask.\n\nThe deal, fortunately, was quickly agreed upon, and \"Sarvaen\" left a small pile of jewels behind, as a token of its good faith.  I calculate their worth to be in excess of 100,000 Pyreal.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Cambarth","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"I do not trust this Thing by any account.

A badly written note, supposedly from him, was found, saying that he went home to Qalaba'r. I know the Thing did it.
