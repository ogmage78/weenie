I have recently been keeping surveillance on one of the newer citizens of this town - a \"reformed\" bandit from Marae Lassel claiming to have turned over a new leaf. It appears that this stranger is not as he claimed. A note found in his possession implied that he was employed to transport a cargo of some sort of substance being collected in the depths of Asuger Temple.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Sir Rylanan","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"The adventurer you see before you penetrated the depths of the temple and found a band of Hollow Minions laboring over a strange device, collecting what looks to be concentrated portal space energy inside emulsified spherules of glass. I cannot fathom the purpose of these spherules--thinking better of performing my own analysis, I have sent the object to the Arcanum for examination.
