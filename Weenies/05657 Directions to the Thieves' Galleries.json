They had stolen a large quantity of art, and has stashed it there until they could sell it off.  Unfortunately, a  group of Banderlings wanted the cave for their own.  The paintings may still be found there.  Head southeast along the road, past the lifestone.  You will see a bend in the road with a tree. Walk outwards in the direction of the point of the road - a series of yellow flower bushes lead into the forest.  When you come to a clearing, you should see the portal.\n"}]}}
