I have never felt such humility as when confronted with the Dragon's fearsome power. As I wrested the brazier free, I knew that I had found its Power.\n\nMy journey is not yet done. I am heading to a remote area, far northeast of Kara, not far southwest of the Mines of Despair. There is a mountain there with a single tree that I have always found peaceful. There I shall bring the elements of the path together as one. I can feel that each has an inner magic seperately but I think that the reward for knowing all three shall be grander.\n"}]}}
