But I hear that you and your people have prospered, and have a big castle in the north to call home. Not bad! For our part, Onda Nakoza and I found ourselves on a hot and humid island, south of the mainland. 'Tis not a bad place, except for the occasional Mosswart raid. I hope everyone there is doing right. Give Jourgenson a punch in the jaw for me, for old times' sake.\n\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"MacNiall the Unruled","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"Oh, and find a good reward for the courier of this letter, if you can. Maybe one of the blade hilts you were working on. Did you ever finish that up? It was a fine idea, to balance a blade for extra strikes.\n\nYour cousin,\nMacNiall\n"}]}}
