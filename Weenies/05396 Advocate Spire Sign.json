They can be identified by their PINK COMPASS DOT and bright, glowing Advocate shield.\n\nTo look for Advocates watching over your starting town, type \"@list <town>\". Example: to find the Advocates currently watching Nanto, type \"@list Nanto\".\n\nTo ask an Advocate for assistance, either walk up to them, or \"tell\" them your request by typing \"@tell <name>, <message>\" (without <>'s). They may be busy helping other people; please be patient.\n"}]}}
