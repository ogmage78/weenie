Rather, they seemed to be split into three distinct factions. One group was loyal to Bael'Zharon. Another, swearing their allegiance to his general Isin Dule, seemed alarmed by the Hopeslayer's blind rage, and appeared to be working to keep him imprisoned. The last faction was barely comprehensible. Loyal to neither Bael'Zharon nor Dule, they were obsessed with \"opening the ways\" for something yet greater than the dread Hopeslayer.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Jaiph Rainshadow","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\nIt is thought that the minions of Bael'Zharon were responsible for the so-called \"Arenas\" that opened at this time. The portals to these underground complexes were restricted to those who had sworn to serve the lord of chaos. Reports of what lay within were hard to come by, but those few who were willing to talk mentioned gladiatorial blood sports fought between and judged by Bael'Zharon's human servants. It was assumed that these arenas were built to hone the prowess of the Hopeslayer's followers for the coming struggle.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Jaiph Rainshadow","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"Meantime, the Dericost undead mobilized at the behest of the Aerfalle, the powerful Lady of Aerlinthe. Adventurers intercepted many messages between the various factions of their society that spoke of gathering armies and collecting intelligence. The Isparians seemed to have gained an ally of sorts against the minions of Bael'Zharon, though perhaps not one they would have chosen. Whereas the Shadows sought to absorb all life, the undead seemed intent on conquering the living after beating off the Enemy. Things seemed bleak for humanity no matter what the outcome of this conflict.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Jaiph Rainshadow","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\nIn the midst of all the alarming news, reclusive mage Aliester the Loquacious discovered that because Shadowhunter Armor was crafted from magical gems, it could be \"attuned\" to the elemental properties of the gemstones crafted by the Yalaini enchanter Lady Maila. Although the plates of armor crafted by the master smiths were still of lesser quality than those made before Hamud ibn Rafik's vicious attacks, inserting any of the stones used in Lord Atlan's ancient weapons could enhance them.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Jaiph Rainshadow","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\nWanderers braving the untamed wilds of the southern Direlands discovered that a clan of undead had recently taken up residence of three towers by the coast. After slaughtering those in the towers, a passage was found to a long-hidden underground temple complex, inhabited by a long-lost cult of undead. The slaying of their High Acolyte yielded a rather distasteful reward.
