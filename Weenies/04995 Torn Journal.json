It is colder than a Tumerok's heart in here!  Fidisa managed to pick the lock of the door near the cavern mouth, and with the rope from my pack, we all rappelled down the sheer drop-off afterwards. The Gelidites did indeed go to great lengths to protect their privacy!  And the walls, embedded with brilliant blue crystals, give off an eerie glow as if they possessed an energy all their own.\n\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Yarick Pathwarden","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\nThere are many tunnels to explore, we will bear rightward according to Palomar's divinations.\n\nEntry 2\n\nWe have wandered the tunnels for more than a day and found little but frozen waste.

Perhaps the piercing cold is ruining our concentration.  Some areas are warmer than others, we will stick to them to preserve energy.  Still no signs of civilization, although we have witnessed disturbing signs of life: noises that seem to come from within the walls themselves, flickers of movement that shadow us every now and then, and the chamber in which we now make camp - a disturbing hollow \n\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Yarick Pathwarden","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\nfurnished only with human skulls.

A symmetrical arrangement of large stones, perfectly shaped.  Could this be the entrance to their lost civilization? There is more to explore downward but it is colder there.

It was as if they were waiting for us to let down our guard.  Hideous reincarnations of the dead, their ghastly visages reflected their single lust - our deaths.  We dispatched them, but Fidisa caught a mortal blow during the melee, and the hideous creatures dragged her corpse away before we could act.  These monoliths will serve as grim markers of the place of her demise.
