This I have rendered as \"kemeroi,\" a direct phonetic equivalent of the original word.\n\nEstablished lore has shown me this word used to describe an unprecedented number of circumstances, most of which are contradictory. By turns, kemeroi is used to express the concepts of stillborn offspring, unwelcome emissary, unseen or stealthy movement, corrupter or tempter, nightmare, madness or terrifying hallucination, unbidden thought, parasite, scream uttered\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Kuyiza bint Zayi","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"at awakening from a nightmare, thing that causes melting, liquid given form by a vessel, the touch of something frozen, and night that moves as a liquid.\n\nThe latter few of these many meanings are the most curious, as kemeroi is not a word of the so-called \"Great Tongue\" of Dericost, but rather the Base Tongue. The Great Tongue, with roots in the archaic dialect of the Falatacot, was used by the artisans as well as the aristocracy (and for that reason some of its words came into use by the Yalaini intelligencia).\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Kuyiza bint Zayi","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\nThis, I feel, implies that descriptions such as \"liquid night\" are not merely poetic license, but literal description.

The dark spawn have now appeared in my cellars as well, below the levels infested by Asheron's vermin. They are older than the ones that trouble you, I believe; Uvriliim and Paanuvriliim. Fortunately, the Kemeroi still sleep. Should they appear again, I think the dark ones would cease to toy with the outlander hoard that vexes Killiakta.

Ever did they neglect to mention the most important details. Trust least of all the oracles that later spawned the traitorous priestess of Ithaenc, potent though that blood may be.

I had established this little colony perhaps three centuries previous, whispering to Loritane through a chain of agents, telling him of the great treasures to be wrought beneath my mountains. He was quick to see my way, remember? His ships arrived so soon. We laughed, you and I, watching them scurry to build their port below Tenkarrdun, to excavate their reservoir, raise their towers, and install their forges. The way you whispered then was masterful - convincing Loritane to name the very island after me - Aerlinthe - \"Stone of the Sky\" in the Great Tongue!

Such subterfuges still leave me heady. A pity Loritane discovered them. Yet it worked out for the best in the end, did it not?

I appealed to His Eternal Splendor and the Steward of Chalicmere, even as my sailing vessels held the vanguard of the enemy off the shores of Aerlinthe with mage-fire and lightning.

The barbarians, long since fled to the west of Killiakta, never knew. But we saved them.

When all had fallen - I believe the last few actually splashed - all I could hear was a ghastly croaking from across the bottom of the hill. I saw a lone beak, a single grey-feathered throat, sticking up out of the charnel pools of flesh; altered and formless, yet clearly, horrifyingly, alive and conscious.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Lady Aerfalle","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\nI always loved the song of the neuzali.

They were my lullaby.\n\nAh, but there at the front ranks of the enemy's hoard  - there marched rogue Firstborn, lead in bitterness by the captive chevaird Leikotha At the head of those deluded souls she stood, sword in hand;\nstill furious at Nerash for turning her,\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Lady Aerfalle","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"and under the sway of Ferah's poison whispers.
