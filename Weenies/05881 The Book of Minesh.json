The Lords of This World, in their arrogance, were thrown down - Sarvien and his circle slain by the whelps of Yalain and Haebrous. The Kingdom crumbled, the Ice Throne was toppled by victorious barbarians. So did we, whose doom was wrought by the arrival of the Falatacot priestesses six thousand years hence, come to have our presence suffered in our own land.\n\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"The Book of Minesh","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\nFeared by the simple creatures who presumed to rule in our stead, we were forbidden to practice the crafts that had made our Lords mighty. We were turned out from our own ancient fortresses on the fastness of Gelid, and resettled in the rank grasslands of Yalain, among herdsmen as dull as their flocks. We were watched and mistrusted - blamed for everything that did not occur as those ignorant peasants thought should. As if we, the living, had had anything to do with the vile acts of the Lords! As if we had traffic with the Thing Ilservian roused!\n\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"The Book of Minesh","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\nThey would hear none of this of course; our blood was that of the royal houses of Dericost, and that was guilt enough in their eyes.\n\nDoomed by the cold that had driven the Falatacot south, shunned by our conquerors, we sought the blessing of another time of cold. Such things come in cycles. The southern barbarians may have forgotten, but the memory of Dericost was ancient of days. Does not the sun itself turn wan and pale every several millennia?\n\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"The Book of Minesh","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\nWe only needed to wait until the next Great Frost, and then our oppressors would burn from wind-whipped ice. If we prepared properly, we should outlast them, and return in glory to high Gelid, which stands mighty over the plains.\n\nIt was foretold by the priestesses that the Fourth Sending would begin in a city of Dericost called Frore, which means \"Black Frost.\" No such city existed during the 6000 years of the Kingdom. So it was decided that we should make for ourselves a city by that name; being blood of the noble houses, our city would be of Dericost.\n\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"The Book of Minesh","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\nDebate raged among the brethren - when should Frore be built, and where? Was it not presumptuous - dangerous - to attempt to fulfill such a prophesy? The prognostications of the Falatacot witches always had hidden barbs.\n\nAs we debated, our oppressors blamed us again for a thing which was not our doing. One of the Old Lords was found in hiding, in the farthest reaches of Haebrous. The Burning Time began, and the sons and daughters of Old Dericost were put to fire and sword for the errors of their grandsires.

The Work must begin. But, where should we go? The Council of Three held fierce debate, but in the end Blessed Fenngar's suggestion won favor; Killiakta, Isle of Woe.\n\nSo did we enjoin our meager wealth, and covertly book passage on ships headed to the isle. All at once, we left the squalid cities of the south, and met with sea-captains in hidden coves along the shore. Our convoy, six ships strong, met off the Rock of Sennaj, where the slate-grey sea endlessly beats itself into a useless froth.\n\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"The Book of Minesh","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\nWe sailed northwest for uncounted leagues. One cold blue twilight, the Great Light of the Yalain mariners was seen over the horizon. We knew then that we had reached the southeast of Killiakta. As the moons crept up the dew-dappled spider-strands of stars, we ordered the captains to steer north.\n\nOur convoy rounded the shoulder of Ifistra, taking care to avoid the patrols from the Yalain port at Aerlinthe. Unmolested, we landed on the northern shore, where the peaks of Ifisveraqu meet the sea. It was here that Blessed Ferundi turned to the ship captains, thanked them for a safe journey, and signaled that we should begin.\n\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"The Book of Minesh","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\nAs the moons stood a placid watch, the shrieks of sailors drowned out the crush and roar of the surf. Though we had not used them for many years, the arts of the Lords were well known to us in lore. So did we use the crews' blood and ash and bone, entrails and meat, for our conversion. A ghastly business it was, but the Work needed to be done. As the sun's first rays shone through the frigid north shore fog, we fired the charnel-house ships, and watched until they had burned to the waterline. No vessel or man passed as we waited, becoming used to our new forms.\n\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"The Book of Minesh","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\nOnce certain no trace would be left of us, we began the trek south, into the mountains.

Some, under Blessed Ferundi, explored the peaks to the east, but this proved too close to the Aerlinthe. This party was lucky to escape detection when a party of Yalain's so-called mages suddenly emerged from a shelter at the base of one of the greater peaks. Others, under Blessed Fenngar, trekked west, but the height of the peaks there were found lacking, and the area too easily approached.\n\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"The Book of Minesh","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\nA third group, under Blessed Frisander, searched the mighty peaks of old Velacixque, \"Blood-Heart\" to the Falatacot.
