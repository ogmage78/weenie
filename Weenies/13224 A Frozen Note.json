All you need are the ingredients and a good place to show off your sculpture.\n   Collect the following: 1 Magic Iceball, 2 Poofy Snowballs, a Strange Stick and a Carrot.\n   Smoosh the Magic Iceball onto a Poofy Snowball to get a snowman torso which you combine with the other Poofy Snowball to get a basic snowman body. Add your Strange Stick for arms and then your Carrot for the nose and you should have a handsome Snowman to show your friends.\n"}]}}
