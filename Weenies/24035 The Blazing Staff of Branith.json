His chosen magic was pyromancy, the way of fire: his foes often met their ends in raging infernos that left nothing but ash in their wake. It was only right, then, that the staff he wielded would evoke flames as well.The Blazing Staff, an Empyrean artifact shaped of sunstone, became famous among wizards across Dereth.
