Seems some undead have made an old Empyrean Shrine their new home. One woman claims to have seen them performing dark rituals and blood sacrifices. I don't know about all of that, but I sure don't need any shrine swiping undead causing trouble for my townsfolk. I hear you adventurer types like taking on these kinds of problems. I also hear that the undead in question may have some nice treasure from all the people they've been killing.\n"}]}}
