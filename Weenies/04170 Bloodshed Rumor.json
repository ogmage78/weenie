Scribes in some other towns know more of one of them.  For the other, you should seek a strange hermit living somewhere between Cragstone and Samsur, a ways further east than 30.0 E, and further north than 10.0 N.  There is also rumored to be a note with more precise directions.  Do not bother pursuing this trail if you are not interested in dueling with others, or if you are not ready for bloodshed.\n"}]}}
