How I have come to know these mountains like the back of my own hand, not that I will always tell of what I know.  I remember the adventuring group that, as full of pride and laughter as I once was, sought to conquer the Syliph Dungeon.  Ha!  They never came back, and they had gone when too often resurrection meant more often than not becoming undead.  I have not seen them since, and I have seen travelers come here aplenty.  Many regret coming to these mountains.\n\n"}]}}
