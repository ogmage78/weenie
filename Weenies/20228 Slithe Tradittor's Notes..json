Due North of the Midsong Festival Stone. Due south of the Recovered Temple Dungeon. Southwest of Al-Jalima.  I had climbed a steep escarpment and walked along the edge of the cliff.  I saw the glow of a portal and as I drew near I saw the hanging bridge suspended out into nothingness. I do not know where in Dereth the portal placed me. Go ever upward! The artifact is at the highest point. Remember to use the Imaging Crystal on the artifact.\n"}]}}
