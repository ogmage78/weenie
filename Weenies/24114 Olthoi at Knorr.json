The latest collection attempt has resulted in the discovery of 3 new variants bringing the total racial variants to over 30. More are discovered as they progress across the world. They have brought only 5 variants of the natural predator to the Olthoi and those have been taken to facilities away from Knorr for the sake of seeing that the subjects here remain unharmed.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Lord Asheron","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"The creatures appear unfocused and will-less incapable of performing any function aside from base survival instincts that include the ingestion of food and preening.
