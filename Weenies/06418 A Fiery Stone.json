In this grotto reside several of the elusive Fire Elementals, said to be star-spawned creatures which retreated underground after a great cataclysm. They now seem to guard a strange red stone. None know what this stone may be, as all who have attempted to retrieve have been blistered by the fireballs of the Elementals.\n"}]}}
