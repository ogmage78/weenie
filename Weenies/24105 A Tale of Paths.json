This was the day of their parting, the first leg of the separate journeys they had chosen to undertake. Two paths, one destination, they would be together at the end if fortune was kind. A parting kiss and they were off, he to the west, she to the east.\n\nOn the second day of his journey Altas found himself thinking often of their first meeting. It had been in Hebian-to.  He had finished downing some ale at the tavern and walked out the door. \n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"Perhaps it was the ale, perhaps it was fate, he found himself walking towards the blacksmith shop across the square. Approaching the shop he saw one customer standing at the window, a female in green mire armor. She turned then and he marvelled at bright green eyes and blazing red hair that seemed to light up the square. She smiled.  He bowed, quite elegantly he thought, rather clumsily she thought, yet in a charming way. They began talking. Such was their first meeting.\n\nShe had a strange dream the second night of her journey.

Not any particular part of Aerlinthe Island, she just knew it was all of Aerlinthe Island right in front of her. The island was covered with the red and blue birds.

They scattered in all directions, leaving him safe to continue onwards.\n\nHaving broken her sword upon the fang of an Ursuin who nevertheless met his fate, Syretta was forced to deviate from her planned route and stop in Eastham.

Syretta opened the door, greeted Rundiscar the Weaponsmith and went to Getram the Armorer who was standing in front of his forge. He laid out four swords on the window facing the town square and another four on the opposite window, offering that she examine each one. She tested the heft of each weapon, the keenness of the blade. She examined several, did not find them to her liking and moved to the other window.

Through the torchlit gloom she could see one wall was carved with Empyrean runes. More mosswarts lunged at her, but they fared no better than the ones above. Syretta was curious about the runes, having studied for a time under a scholar who had given her some understanding of Empyrean writing.
