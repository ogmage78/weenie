Follow it east. After Eotenstoth Peak, it will start curving north around the mountain. Don't worry about that; you're not lost. Not if you've been paying attention, anyway.\n     The valley will end in a box canyon, with Eotenstoth on your left. In the canyon, you'll find a portal marked \"Land of Bandits\". This would be a fine place to turn back, if you're having second thoughts. No one will hold it against you.

It leads right to the castle. Don't approach without announcing yourself, though - you never know when there's going to be an archer or three waiting on the battlements to feather your skull.\n"}]}}
