Almost simultaneously, a wave of fierce portal-energy squalls slid down the length of the Direlands, bringing with them fiercer varieties of banderling, shreth, and other familiar creatures. The scholars of Hebian-to, Zaikhal, and Cragstone argued that these events were too coincidental, and had to be somehow related. It was previously known that the Spires could disturb portalspace, as portals had begun to appear at random on the landscape at the same time they rose.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Jaiph Rainshadow","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\n\nOther creatures made their first appearance in Seedsow.

Wandering mages in the wilderness claimed that mysterious voices from the darkness offered them \"long-dormant powers\" if they attempted bizarre combinations of reagents. The source of these whispers was not discovered. While hard to learn and cast, the new spells, including rings and streaks, spread quickly by word of mouth.\n"},{"AuthorID":4294967295,"AuthorName":"Jaiph Rainshadow","AuthorAccount":"prewritten","IgnoreAuthor":false,"Text":"\n\nIn local news, Yu Vuo-Ki and her sister Dansha-Ki moved to the north of besieged town of Dryreach.
